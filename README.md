# Key_Drivers_For_Quality_Coffee
A quantitative analysis for the key drivers of high quality coffee

According to the Coffee Quality Institute (CQI), coffee quality is one of the most important variables that influence a coffee’s value.
One way that coffee quality can be measured is through a blind tasting, also known as cupping, by certified coffee analysts using the
SCAA Cupping Protocol. This protocol gives guidelines for evaluation ranging from necessary equipment to preparation of the coffee.
Ratings are given in various categories such as aroma, flavor, aftertaste, acidity, body, balance, sweetness, clarity, consistency, and
overall impression. The final grade sums the ratings against a total of 100 points, similar to rating scales used for wine and similar
goods. Anything rated over 80 points is considered a premium coffee. This method of evaluation provides a consistent and objective
methodology for capturing some of the beans’ sensory aspects and for evaluating quality.

The CQI’s goal is to improve the quality of coffee and the lives of coffee producers. As a result, the CQI compiled a dataset of samples
submitted for evaluation for coffees worldwide. The dataset provides a profile of coffee growers, coffee beans and the quality of the
coffee grown, as measured according to the SCAA categories. Analysis of this dataset could result in valuable findings that would
improve production practices. Our data was gathered from https://www.kaggle.com/volpatto/coffee-quality-database-from-cqi,
which contained 1339 observations and 43 variables from the CQI database of coffee ratings from 2010 through 2018. Each
observation represents a sample of coffee and 43 variables associated with it.

The main purpose of our analysis was to figure out if there were associations between the quality ratings of coffee and other
information contained in the dataset, and if so, whether these had predictive power. We also investigated to see if there were other
patterns in the data. The variables in the set generally fall into three categories that portray different characteristics for each sample
of coffee (seen below). A more detailed listing of variables is provided in the appendix.
