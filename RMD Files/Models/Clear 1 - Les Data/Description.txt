"1" "Using the data from the previous iteration. Lambda 1Se regularization performed best using a training and sample dataset of 80/20. The best RMSE was using elasticNet at alpha = .05. THe RMSE results were not that different between them. Thus, I decided to use Ridge regression as it does not exclude any variables.  Ridge regression showed huge outliers when compared to the standardized residuzals.  In this iteration, I decided to remove those extreme outliers.  8 Observations were seen to be over and under -3.5 standard deviations of the standardized residuals. The final number of observations in this iteration is 948. In addition, I also removed the variables that contained too many factor levels. Those were variety, region, country and certBody. These variables had too many levels without enough obervations within each level.  Also, I removed the data variables because the date frames did not have a consistent enough time frames to be useable. In this iteration, I also performed 3 transformations. I logged Moisture, I reduced avgAltitude by a factor of 1000, and I subtracted 2000 from the harvest year (that way, the data would only reflect the decade it was harvest, 2014 = 14) "
